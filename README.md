# Collatz Conjecture Project

This repository hosts all computational and documentation resources for the research paper **“Global Descent and Convergent Classes in the Collatz Conjecture”**

It provides a reproducible environment for validating structural and statistical claims related to the 3n+1 (Collatz) problem. This includes:

- High-precision C++ code for orbit exploration (with optional—but recommended—GMP support, enabled by default)
- Python scripts for coverage analysis, ratio studies, and figure generation
- A reproducible pipeline producing all figures in PDF format
- LaTeX source for the formal research paper

While a formal proof involves advanced theoretical arguments, this repository focuses on **exhaustive computational validation** of predicted orbit structures, equivalence classes, and **global descent behavior** over extremely large integers.  Arbitrary-precision validation comes at a computational cost, which motivated the use of GNU MP libraries.

------------------------------------------------------------

## 🛠️ Canonical Build (LaTeX)

The official build uses `latexmk` for consistency.  
From the repository root, run:

```bash
latexmk -pdf -interaction=nonstopmode -output-directory=build src/latex/Asymptotic_Density_of_Convergent_Classes.tex
```

### VS Code Build Task (Alternative)

A VS Code task is provided so you can build the paper by pressing:

Ctrl+Shift+B (Windows/Linux)  
Cmd+Shift+B (Mac)

This produces:

```bash
build/Global_Descent_Convergent_Classes.pdf
```

------------------------------------------------------------

## 📄 Outputs

This project produces several categories of outputs:

- **Final paper (PDF):**  
  `build/Global_Descent_Convergent_Classes.pdf` — the compiled LaTeX research paper.

- **Generated figures:**  
  `figures/` — PDFs of plots generated by Python scripts. File naming follows a consistent convention for cross-referencing in the paper (e.g., `11_Term_Coverage.pdf`).

- **Raw data files:**  
  `data/` — text or CSV files containing numeric data used to generate figures. These files are intermediate and may be used for reproducibility checks.

- **C++ API Documentation (HTML):**  
  Generated using Doxygen (optional). See `/build/doxygen/html/` for the HTML output. Requires `make doxygen` from the `/cpp` directory.

**Note:** Intermediate LaTeX compilation files (log, aux, etc.) are created in `build/` but are typically ignored for version control.

## 📚 Documentation Overview

This project uses multiple Markdown documents to separate concerns and clarify intended audiences:

- **Code-level design and sequence implementations:** `/src/cpp/README.md`  
  Provides developers with detailed explanations of C++ classes, templates, OEIS sequences, and algorithmic decisions.

- **Computational environment and software versions:** `/src/cpp/ENVIRONMENT.md`  
  Lists the exact software, toolchain, libraries, and versions used to generate validated results. Intended for reproducibility and auditing.

- **Build and installation instructions:** `/src/cpp/INSTALL.md`  
  Step-by-step instructions to build the LaTeX paper, Python scripts, and C++ executables on supported platforms.

- **Third party components:** `/third_party/README.md`  
  Provides a breakdown of utilized build or rendering components not directly generated by this project.

- **C++ API reference (HTML):**  
  Generated via Doxygen (`/build/doxygen/html/`) for detailed class and function documentation.

**Purpose:**  
This separation ensures that high-level users can navigate quickly to paper-related outputs, while developers or reproducibility auditors can access the full technical and implementation details without distraction.

**Prerequisites for LaTeX / Doxygen Documentation**

- A TeX distribution (e.g., TeX Live, MiKTeX, or MacTeX) is required to generate the LaTeX PDF output.
- Doxygen HTML documentation relies on MathJax for rendering formulas; a local TeX distribution ensures proper rendering of math in both PDF and HTML outputs.

## 📂 Directory Structure

| Directory | Contents |
|----------|----------|
| `/src/latex` | LaTeX source for the paper (`Global_Descent_Convergent_Classes.tex`) |
| `/src/python` | Python analysis and figure-generation scripts (`*.py`) |
| `/src/cpp` | High-precision C++ Collatz implementation (`*.cpp`, `*.hpp`, `Makefile`) |
| `/.venv` | Python virtual environment |
| `/.vscode` | VS Code project files such as `launch.json` and `tasks.json` to assist in builds / execution
| `/figures` | Generated PDF plots (`*.pdf`) |
| `/data` | Raw data files (`*.txt`, `*.csv`) |
| `/build` | Build outputs for LaTeX and Doxygen, e.g., `Global_Descent_Convergent_Classes.pdf` and `/doxygen/html` |
| `/bin` | Executables which are a product of /src/cpp compilations |
| `/third_party` | Third-party components which help execute the workflow, but are not *produced* by the project |
| `/` | Project files (e.g. `CMakeLists.txt`, `Doxyfile.in`) |

**Notes:**

- The Python virtual environment may optionally reside under `/src/python` if preferred.
- Doxygen HTML output is generated under `/build/doxygen/html` when `make doxygen` is run in `/src/cpp`.
- `/src` contains only source directories, separating LaTeX, Python, and C++ code for clarity.

------------------------------------------------------------

## ⚙️ Python Setup

Create and activate a clean Python virtual environment:

Mac/Linux:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
which python
```

Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
Get-Command python
```

Verify that the environment is clean and only essential packages are present:

```bash
pip list
```

Install the required dependencies exactly as specified:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

------------------------------------------------------------

## 🚀 C++ Executable

For details on building and running the high-precision C++ Collatz implementation (with optional GMP support), see [`/src/cpp/README.md`](src/cpp/README.md).

------------------------------------------------------------

## 📊 Reproducible Figure Generation

Most figures are generated using:

```bash
python python/generate_all_figures.py
```


This script:

- Loads data from `/data`
- Generates all plots using Matplotlib with LaTeX text rendering
- Writes the output PDFs to `/figures`
- Uses consistent naming conventions such as `11_Term_Coverage.pdf`
