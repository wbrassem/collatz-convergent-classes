\begin{abstract}

We study the accelerated Collatz map
\[
f(x) = \begin{cases}
\displaystyle
    \phantom{3x} \frac{x}{2} & \text {if } x \text{ is even}, \\[8pt]
\displaystyle
    \frac{3x+1}{2}           & \text {if } x \text{ is odd},
\end{cases}
\]
and analyze integer trajectories through parity-encoded residue classes.
For fixed length, each admissible parity word determines a residue class
modulo a power of two, and these classes are pairwise disjoint. Convergent
parity words correspond to classes whose elements reach a strictly smaller
integer after finitely many iterations.

Using explicit enumeration of admissible parity words and their associated
division counts, we show that each convergent residue class admits a
well-defined asymptotic density. Grouping these classes by minimal stopping
time yields, at each level, a finite disjoint family whose cumulative density
increases monotonically. The asymptotic density encodes the fraction of
integers guaranteed to decrease at each stopping time, providing a quantitative
measure of global descent. We prove that the density contribution of newly
appearing convergent classes tends to zero as the stopping time grows.
Consequently, the total density of the union of convergent residue classes
approaches one.

Because the parity-induced residue classes form a partition of the positive
integers, every integer must belong to some convergent residue class of finite
stopping time and therefore eventually reaches a smaller positive integer
under iteration of the Collatz map. This establishes global descent and rules
out the existence of nontrivial cycles in the positive integers, leaving the
classical \(4 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 4\) cycle as the unique
periodic orbit.

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{The Collatz Mapping and Known Results}

The Collatz conjecture concerns the iteration of a simple piecewise-defined map
introduced by Lothar Collatz in 1937~\cite{Collatz1937}, defined as follows.

\begin{define}[Standard Collatz Map]
\label{def:standard-map}
The \emph{standard Collatz map} $g : \setN \to \setN$ is defined by
\[
g(x) =
\begin{cases}
\displaystyle
    \phantom{3x} \frac{x}{2} & \text {if } x \text{ is even}, \\[8pt]
\displaystyle
    3x+1,                    & \text{if $x$ is odd}.
\end{cases}
\]
\end{define}

In this paper, we primarily study the accelerated map defined below on the
positive integers.  All results are stated in terms of the accelerated map
\( f \), which is dynamically equivalent to the standard Collatz map \( g \)
in the sense that each orbit of \( g \) corresponds to an orbit of  \( f \)
obtained by collapsing consecutive divisions by two, and vice versa. 

\begin{define}[Accelerated Collatz Map]
\label{def:accelerated-map}
The \emph{accelerated Collatz map} is the function
\( f : \setN \rightarrow \setN \) defined by
\[
f(x) = \begin{cases}
\displaystyle
    \phantom{3x} \frac{x}{2} & \text {if } x \text{ is even}, \\[8pt]
\displaystyle
    \frac{3x+1}{2}           & \text {if } x \text{ is odd}. \\
\end{cases}
\]
This map acts on the positive integers and combines each odd step of the classical Collatz
iteration \(x \mapsto 3x+1\) with the immediately following division by two
\cite{Everett1977}.
\end{define}

The Collatz conjecture asserts that, under iteration of $f$, every positive
integer eventually reaches the trivial cycle $2 \to 1 \to 2$, which corresponds
to the classical $4 \to 2 \to 1 \to 4$ cycle under the standard map $g$
\cite{Collatz1937}.

Despite its elementary formulation, the conjecture has resisted proof for decades
\cite{Lagarias2010,Terras1976}. Extensive computational verification confirms convergence
for all integers up to very large bounds \cite{OliveiraESilva2010}, but such verification
does not constitute a proof and offers limited insight into the global structure
of Collatz trajectories.

Many prior approaches focus on bounding individual trajectories or probabilistic heuristics 
\cite{Wirsching1998}. While these methods provide valuable intuition, they do not directly
address the problem at the level of the entire positive integer space.


\subsection{Strategy of the Proof}

This paper adopts a structural approach based on decomposing the
positive integers into arithmetic residue classes determined by parity
patterns under the accelerated Collatz map.

The central idea is to study finite Collatz paths abstractly and to associate each such
path with a pairwise disjoint residue class of integers that follow the same parity
pattern for a fixed number of odd steps. Each class is assigned a minimal stopping time,
defined as the first iterate at which all elements of the class map to a value strictly
smaller than their initial value. The key novelty is to control the global behavior of
these classes by analyzing the \emph{grammar of admissible parity words} and the maximal
multiplicative growth they permit.

The proof proceeds through the following steps:
\begin{itemize}
\item Encode Collatz trajectories using parity words that record the
      number of divisions by two between odd steps.
\item Show that each admissible parity word (i.e., one satisfying the
      prefix-wise growth constraint) induces an arithmetic residue class
      of positive integers.
\item Prove that convergent residue classes of fixed stopping time are
      pairwise disjoint.
\item Express the asymptotic density of each class in terms of its
      total division count.
\item Analyze the grammar of admissible parity words to identify all
      possible local growth patterns, and establish sharp upper bounds
      on the multiplicative growth associated with each such pattern.
\item Show that the locally maximal growth pattern corresponds to a
      $5$--cycle which is globally forbidden by the grammar, and that
      an infinite concatenation of this forbidden word therefore provides
      a strict upper envelope on the growth of all admissible words.
\item Deduce that the density contribution of newly appearing convergent
      classes tends to zero as the stopping time increases, so that the
      union of all convergent residue classes has asymptotic density one.
\item Conclude that for every positive integer $n$, there exists an iterate
      $k$ such that $f^k(n) < n$, establishing global descent and ruling out
      non-trivial cycles.
\end{itemize}

By focusing on cumulative densities of the positive integers via convergent
structures, and by bounding growth through extremal but grammatically
forbidden parity patterns, this approach provides a global and deterministic
mechanism for descent under the Collatz map, independent of probabilistic
heuristics or trajectory-by-trajectory analysis.


\section{Definitions and Preliminaries}

\subsection{Stopping Time}

\begin{define}
The \emph{stopping time} \( \sigma(x) \) of a positive integer \(x\) is the minimal integer
\(k \in \setN\) (if such a \(k\) exists) such that
\[
f^k(x) < x.
\]
If no such $k$ exists, we say that $x$ has infinite stopping time. Stopping time has been
studied in the context of the $3x+1$ problem.
\cite{Terras1976}.
\end{define}

\subsection{Convergent Segments}

\begin{define}
A \emph{convergent segment of length \(k\)} is a finite sequence
\[
x, f(x), f^2(x), \ldots, f^k(x)
\]
such that \( f^k(x) < x \) and \(k\) is minimal. Finite segments of this type were
considered in the context of the accelerated Collatz map by Everett \cite{Everett1977}.
\end{define}


\subsection{Residue Classes}

\begin{define}
Two positive integers \(x,y \in \setN\) are said to be in the same \emph{residue class of
depth \(k\)} if their first \(k\) Collatz iterates are identical. The idea of encoding
trajectories via residue classes or arithmetic progressions has appeared in prior works on
symbolic and structural approaches to the $3x+1$ problem \cite{Wirsching1998,Chamberland2003}.
\end{define}

\begin{define}[Residue Class of Depth \(k\)]
Fix \(k \in \setN\) and \(x \in \setN\). The \emph{residue class of depth \(k\)}
containing \(x\) is
\[
[x]_k := \{ y \in \setN \mid f^i(y) = f^i(x) \text{ for } i = 0, 1, \dots, k-1 \}.
\]
\end{define}

\begin{define}[Convergent Residue Class]
A residue class \([x]_k\) is called \emph{convergent of stopping time \(k\)} if
\[
f^k(y) < y \quad \text{for all } y \in [x]_k.
\]
\end{define}


\section{Division Counts and Path Encoding}
\label{sec:division-counts}

The structure of convergent residue classes is governed by the total number
of divisions by two incurred along a Collatz path, which depends only on the
parity pattern of the path and not on the specific starting integer.

In this section we will refer to the sequence of division counts after each odd step
as a \emph{parity word}. A formal definition of parity words, together with
the admissibility conditions that govern them, appears in Section~\ref{sec:grammar}.

\subsection{Total Division Count}

Let a Collatz path contain exactly $k$ odd steps (``up-legs''). Between
successive odd steps, the accelerated Collatz map applies a finite number
of divisions by two. The cumulative number of such divisions determines
the arithmetic structure of the corresponding residue class.

\begin{define}[Total Division Count]
Let $k \ge 0$. For a given parity word with $k$ odd steps and division
counts $d_0, \dots, d_{k-1}$, define its \emph{total division count} by
\[
D = \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} d_i.
\]
\end{define}

\begin{remark}[Empty Parity Words and Purely Even Trajectories]
The case $k=0$ corresponds to \emph{empty parity words}, representing numbers
that are even and experience no odd steps before decreasing below their starting
value. These paths are trivially convergent under repeated division by two,
and their corresponding residue class is simply the set of powers of 2.
Thus, the parity word framework naturally includes purely even sequences
without requiring special treatment.
\end{remark}

Parity words with the same number of odd steps may differ in the
distribution of divisions by two between steps and hence in their total
division count. However, for each parity word the value of $D$ is uniquely
determined by its parity structure.

\begin{define}[Minimal Total Division Count]
Let $A020914(k)$ denote the minimal total number of divisions by two among
all parity words containing exactly $k$ odd steps.
\end{define}

This quantity coincides with $\lceil \log_2(3^k) \rceil$, the number of binary
digits of $3^k$, as tabulated by \OEIS{A020914}. Its role here is purely arithmetic:
it records the smallest possible exponent of $2$ appearing in the denominator of
the iterated map for a path with $k$ odd steps, a perspective implicit in earlier
analyses of stopping times and parity sequences
\cite{Terras1976,Wirsching1998}.


\subsection{Density of Residue Classes}

\begin{lemma}[Disjointness of Residue Classes]
For fixed $k$, the residue classes induced by distinct parity words are pairwise disjoint.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Each parity word with $k$ odd steps and total division count $D$
determines a unique residue class of the form
\[
n \equiv r \pmod{2^{D}},
\]
with exactly one representative per period of length $2^{D}$. If two
distinct parity words produced the same residue class, they would induce
identical arithmetic progressions and hence identical Collatz
trajectories, contradicting the uniqueness of the parity encoding.
Therefore, distinct words correspond to distinct residue classes, and the
associated classes are disjoint.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
A residue class with total division count $D$ has asymptotic density
\[
2^{-D}.
\]
In particular, for any class with $k$ odd steps,
\[
\text{density} \le 2^{-A020914(k)}.
\]
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Each class is an arithmetic progression with step size $2^{D}$
and exactly one representative per period. The result follows.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
At fixed $k$, there are finitely many distinct convergent residue classes.
Let $\widetilde A(k)$ denote the number of such classes. Since these classes
are pairwise disjoint, their total density contribution at stopping time $k$ is
\[
\widetilde A(k)\,2^{-A020914(k)}.
\]
\end{remark}


\subsection{Example}

For convergent segments with $k=4$ odd steps, the minimal total division
count is $A020914(4)=7$. For parity words attaining this minimum, the
associated residue classes consist of integers of the form
\[
x = 2^7 n + r, \quad n \in \setN,
\]
where the residue $r$ depends on the specific parity word. Each such
residue $r$ corresponds to exactly one minimal parity word of length $4$.

This example illustrates that convergent behavior depends only on parity
structure and accumulated division count, motivating an abstract
description of Collatz trajectories independent of their starting values.



\section{Grammar of Collatz Parity Words}
\label{sec:grammar}

\subsection{Parity Words as Dynamical Encodings}

\begin{remark}[Parity Grammar as a Dynamical Encoding]
The parity-word grammar introduced in this section provides a symbolic
encoding of accelerated Collatz trajectories, following the symbolic approach
introduced by Chamberland~\cite{Chamberland2003}. 

This encoding is not injective: multiple positive integers can correspond to the
same parity word. Specifically, distinct integers whose trajectories share the
same sequence of division counts after $k$ odd steps map to the same parity
word, forming arithmetic residue classes as defined in
Section~\ref{sec:division-counts}.

Unlike a purely combinatorial encoding, parity words retain essential dynamical
information. Each parity word $(d_0,\dots,d_{k-1})$ determines the sequence of
divisions by two after each odd step.
\[
r_i = \frac{3}{2^{d_i}}
\]
so that the contractive or expansive contribution of each step is preserved.
This property is sufficient to rigorously quantify densities of convergent
residue classes, establish global descent, and exclude non-trivial cycles,
even though individual trajectories are collapsed under the encoding.
\end{remark}


\subsection{Formal Definition of Parity Words}

\begin{define}[Parity Word]
A \emph{parity word} of length \(k \ge 0\) is a finite sequence
\[
\omega = (d_0, d_1, \dots, d_{k-1}),
\]
where each \(d_i \in \setN_{\ge 1}\) denotes the number of divisions by two
applied after the $i$-th odd step (with indexing starting at $i=0$) of an\
accelerated Collatz trajectory.

For \(k=0\), the sequence is empty and corresponds to a trajectory with no
odd steps.
\end{define}

Each parity word determines a linear-affine transformation
\[
x \longmapsto \frac{3^k x + c(\omega)}{2^{d_0+\cdots+d_{k-1}}},
\]
where \(c(\omega)\) is a canonical integer uniquely determined by the
parity word (see Appendix~\ref{app:canonical-c}).  
This expression shows that each parity word encodes a rational linear map on integers.

\begin{remark}[Parity Words Encode Structure, Not Values]
Fixing a parity word $\omega$ determines the sequence of arithmetic
operations applied along an accelerated Collatz trajectory. Consequently,
both the linear coefficient \(3^k/2^{d_0+\cdots+d_{k-1}}\) and the affine term
\(c(\omega)\) depend only on $\omega$ and not on the starting integer.

Thus, convergence or divergence is a property of the parity word itself
and applies uniformly to all elements of the induced residue class.
\end{remark}


\subsection{Admissibility of Parity Words}

\begin{define}[Admissible Parity Word]
A parity word $\omega = (d_0, \dots, d_{k-1})$ is \emph{admissible} if there exists
a positive integer $x$ realizing $\omega$ such that the induced affine map
\[
T_\omega(x) = \frac{3^k x + c(\omega)}{2^{d_0+\cdots+d_{k-1}}}
\]
yields a positive integer.

Admissibility depends implicitly on the minimal total division count $A020914(k)$,
ensuring that the affine map maps integers to integers.
\end{define}

\begin{lemma}[Minimal Division Count]
For any admissible parity word of length $k$,
\[
d_0 + \cdots + d_{k-1} \ge A020914(k),
\]
where $A020914(k)$ denotes the minimal total number of divisions by two required
to clear denominators in an accelerated Collatz trajectory with $k$ odd steps. 
Equality holds if and only if the parity word achieves admissibility with minimal
total division count.
\end{lemma}

\begin{define}[Convergent Parity Word]
An admissible parity word $\omega = (d_0,\dots,d_{k-1})$ is
\emph{convergent} if
\[
\frac{3^k}{2^{d_0+\cdots+d_{k-1}}} < 1.
\]
\end{define}


\subsection{Residue Classes Induced by Parity Words}

Fix a parity word $\omega$ of length $k$ that is realizable by some positive
integer $x$.  Let $A020914(k)$ denote the minimal total number of divisions
by two along any path realizing $\omega$.

\begin{lemma}[Residue Class Modulus]
Let $x,y \in \setN$ both realize the same parity word $\omega$ with division
counts $(d_0, \dots, d_{k-1})$. Then
\[
x \equiv y \pmod{2^{d_0 + \cdots + d_{k-1}}}.
\]
In particular, $2^{A020914(k)} \le 2^{d_0 + \cdots + d_{k-1}}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Each odd step contributes a factor of 3 in the numerator, while each even
step contributes a factor of 2 in the denominator.  After $k$ odd steps, the
accumulated denominator is exactly $2^{d_0 + \cdots + d_{k-1}}$, independent
of the starting integer.  Hence, all integers realizing $\omega$ lie in a
single residue class modulo $2^{d_0 + \cdots + d_{k-1}}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}[Associated Collatz Map]
\label{lem:associated-map}
Each parity word $\omega = (d_0, \dots, d_{k-1})$ induces an affine map
\[
T_\omega(x) = \frac{3^k x + c(\omega)}{2^{d_0 + \cdots + d_{k-1}}},
\]
where $c(\omega)$ is the unique integer satisfying
\[
0 \le c(\omega) < 2^{d_0 + \cdots + d_{k-1}}
\]
for which $T_\omega(x) \in \setN$ for all integers realizing $\omega$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{remark}[Affine Compression of Trajectories]
For any integer realizing a parity word $\omega$, the value
$T_\omega(x)$ coincides exactly with the result of applying the
Collatz map through the $k$ odd steps encoded by $\omega$, including
all intermediate divisions by two. Thus, the affine map $T_\omega$ represents
a compression of the corresponding finite Collatz trajectory into a single step.
\end{remark}

\begin{lemma}[Convergent Residue Class]
\label{lem:residue_class}
Each convergent parity word $\omega$ induces a residue class
\[
x \equiv r_\omega \pmod{2^{d_0 + \cdots + d_{k-1}}},
\]
whose elements all follow the same Collatz parity pattern for $k$ odd steps and reach
an integer strictly smaller than the starting value after at most $k$ odd steps.
\end{lemma}


\section{Increment Grammar and Horizontal-Sum Construction}
\label{sec:increment-grammar}

\begin{remark}[Increment Grammar from Minimal Denominator Growth]
The first-difference sequence of $A020914$, given by \OEIS{A022921},
induces a binary \emph{increment grammar} $\{s,d\}$ that describes the growth
of the \emph{minimal admissible} total division count as the number of odd steps increases.

Each symbol records whether the minimal total division count increases by one ($s$) or
two ($d$) when passing from $k$ to $k+1$ odd steps.  Importantly, this grammar \emph{does not}
encode the realized parity word entries $d_i$  (which may be arbitrarily large), but rather
governs the evolution of the minimal denominator required for admissibility.

The increment grammar underlies the \emph{horizontal-sum construction} used to enumerate
all convergent parity words. Specifically, admissible local patterns within the $\{s,d\}$
grammar determine the combinatorial growth of $\widetilde A(k)$ independently of the particular
values of the parity word entries.
\end{remark}

\begin{proposition}
The number of convergent parity words of length $k$ is given by \OEIS{A186009}.
\end{proposition}

\begin{lemma}[Single-to-Double Row Sum Bound]
\label{lem:single-double-bound}
Consider a row produced by a single increment step with total sum $k$.  If a double increment
is applied immediately afterward, the resulting row has total sum at most $3k$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By definition, the total sum of the single row equals $k$.  
Under a subsequent double step, the terminal entry of the new row is formed as the
sum of all entries of the preceding row, and the previous terminal entry is duplicated.

Thus the double row consists of:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The interior entries of the single row, whose total is $\le k$;
    \item One terminal entry equal to $k$; and
    \item A duplicated terminal entry, also equal to $k$.
\end{enumerate}

Hence the total sum of the double row is bounded by
\[
k + k + k = 3k.
\]
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}[Controlled Maximal Growth]
This lemma ensures that doubling steps contribute at most a controlled multiplicative
factor to horizontal-sum growth, independent of the global cycle structure.  Consequently,
all admissible local patterns within a finite cycle admit finite maximal growth factors,
which can be explicitly enumerated (see Appendix~\ref{app:local-growth-details}).  
These bounds are key to establishing the vanishing density of residue classes with
increasingly long stopping times.
\end{remark}


\section{Cumulative Density of Convergent Classes}

\subsection{Density Contributions and Denominator Growth}

Define
\[
\widetilde A(i) := A186009(i+1),
\]
so that $\widetilde A(i)$ counts convergent residue classes of stopping time $i$.

Let
\[
B(i) := A020914(i),
\]
so that the density contribution of convergent residue classes of stopping time $i$ is
\[
\widetilde A(i)\, 2^{-B(i)}.
\]

By definition of $A020914$ as the minimal exponent with $2^{B(i)} > 3^i$, the function
$B(i)$ satisfies the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $B(i)$ is strictly increasing, with increments either 1 or 2 (never zero).
    \item Asymptotically, $B(i) \sim (\log_2 3)\, i$.
    \item By construction, $2^{B(i)} > 3^i$ for all $i \ge 0$.
\end{itemize}

Because $2^{B(i)}$ is a power of two and $B(i)$ is defined as the minimal
integer such that $2^{B(i)} > 3^i$, it follows that $2^{B(i)}$ is the smallest
power of two exceeding $3^i$. Since consecutive powers of two differ by a
factor of $2$, we obtain the sharp bound
\[
3^i < 2^{B(i)} < 2 \cdot 3^i \quad \text{where } B(i) = A020914(i)
\]

\begin{remark}[Indexing and Effective Growth Delay]
The OEIS sequences \(A020914\) and \(A186009\) employ differing indexing
conventions. In order to compare numerator and denominator growth on a common
scale, we define \(\widetilde A(i) := A186009(i+1)\), so that the index \(i\)
corresponds uniformly to stopping time (equivalently, parity-word length).

While the first doubling increment in \(A020914\) occurs at index \(1\), its
effect on \(\widetilde A\) appears after a fixed finite delay of two growth
steps. This delay is independent of \(i\) and does not affect the asymptotic
growth comparison between numerator and denominator, which is controlled by
the increment grammar introduced in Section~\ref{sec:increment-grammar}.
\end{remark}

\noindent
\textbf{Constant-factor control.}
This bound depends only on the definition of $A020914$ and does not rely on
any delayed-doubling or numerator-growth arguments. Consequently, the reciprocal satisfies
\[
2^{-B(i)} \in \left( \frac{1}{2 \cdot 3^i}, \frac{1}{3^i} \right),
\]
providing a uniform constant-factor bound for the density contribution at stopping time $i$.

We now record this observation formally for later reference.
\begin{lemma}[Uniform Control of Density Contributions]
\label{lem:uniform-control}
For all $i \ge 0$,
\[
3^i < 2^{A020914(i)} < 2\cdot 3^i.
\]
Consequently, the density contribution of convergent residue classes of
stopping time $i$, given by \(\widetilde A(i) 2^{-A020914(i)}\), satisfies
\[
\frac{\widetilde A(i)}{2 \cdot 3^i}
\;<\;
\widetilde A(i)\,2^{-A020914(i)}
\;<\;
\frac{\widetilde A(i)}{3^i}.
\]
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By definition, $A020914(i)$ is the minimal integer $m$ such that $2^m > 3^i$.
Consecutive powers of two differ by a factor of $2$, so
\[
3^i < 2^{A020914(i)} < 2 \cdot 3^i.
\]
Taking reciprocals and multiplying by $\widetilde A(i)$ gives the stated bounds.
\end{proof}


\subsection{Growth Rate of the Number of Convergent Classes}

\begin{theorem}[Maximal Admissible Growth Rate for $\widetilde A = A186009$]
\label{thm:maximal-growth}
Let $\widetilde A(i)=A186009(i+1)$ be generated by the horizontal-sum
construction associated with the increment grammar of \OEIS{A022921}, and let
$B(i):=A020914(i)$ denote the cumulative exponent of $2$ up to level $i$.

Then
\[
\limsup_{i\to\infty} \widetilde A(i)^{1/i} < 3,
\]
and consequently
\[
\frac{\widetilde A(i)}{2^{B(i)}} \longrightarrow 0 \quad \text{as } i\to\infty.
\]
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The increment sequence \OEIS{A022921} induces a finite symbolic grammar on symbols
\(\{s,d\}\), corresponding respectively to single and double increments in the
horizontal-sum construction.  

Among all admissible sequences, the first potentially expansive configuration is the \emph{5-cycle}
\[
\{s, d, s, d, d\}.
\]
Explicit computation of its net horizontal-sum growth factor gives
\[
\rho_5 := \bigl(\text{total sum after 5-cycle}\bigr)^{1/5} < 3.
\]

Since any admissible infinite sequence is a concatenation of such cycles (or smaller fragments),
the per-step geometric growth of \(\widetilde A(i)\) is always bounded above by \(\rho_5\). Consequently,
\[
\limsup_{i\to\infty} \widetilde A(i)^{1/i} \le \rho_5 < 3.
\]

Finally, since the denominator satisfies
\[
3^i < 2^{B(i)} < 2\cdot 3^i
\]
(Lemma~\ref{lem:uniform-control}), we conclude
\[
\frac{\widetilde A(i)}{2^{B(i)}} \le \frac{C \,\rho_5^i}{3^i} \longrightarrow 0,
\]
which completes the proof.
\end{proof}


\subsection{Vanishing of the Cumulative Density}

The preceding results show that although the number of convergent residue classes
$\widetilde A(i)$ grows with stopping time, its growth rate is strictly dominated
by the denominator $2^{B(i)}$, which scales asymptotically as $3^i$.

By Lemma~\ref{lem:uniform-control}, the density contribution at level $i$ satisfies
\[
\widetilde A(i)\,2^{-B(i)} \;\asymp\; \frac{\widetilde A(i)}{3^i}.
\]
By Theorem~\ref{thm:maximal-growth}, we have
\[
\frac{\widetilde A(i)}{3^i} \longrightarrow 0.
\]
Therefore the density contribution of newly appearing convergent residue classes
tends to zero as the stopping time increases.

In particular, the cumulative density of all convergent classes is dominated by a
summable sequence of vanishing contributions, ensuring that the set of integers
not belonging to any convergent residue class has asymptotic density zero.


\section{Global Descent}

\begin{theorem}[Global Descent]
\label{thm:global-descent}
Every positive integer eventually reaches a smaller positive integer
under iteration of the Collatz map.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
By Theorem~\ref{thm:maximal-growth}, the density contribution of convergent
residue classes of stopping time $i$ satisfies
\[
\frac{\widetilde A(i)}{2^{B(i)}} \longrightarrow 0 \quad \text{as } i \to \infty.
\]
Consequently, the cumulative density of convergent residue classes approaches 1. 
Since the residue classes form a partition of the positive integers, 
every integer must belong to some convergent residue class of finite stopping time.

For each such residue class, there exists a finite integer $k$ such that
the $k$-fold application of the \emph{accelerated} Collatz map (counting only
odd steps, with all intervening divisions by $2$ absorbed into a single step)
satisfies
\[
f^k(x) < x.
\]
Since any additional divisions by $2$ required between odd steps do not increase
the number of odd iterations, the same inequality holds after a finite number of
iterations of the standard Collatz map. Hence every positive integer eventually
reaches a smaller positive integer under iteration of the Collatz map.
\end{proof}

Global Descent implies that no positive integer can remain perpetually above
its initial value, leaving only the trivial 1-2-4 cycle as a recurrent orbit.


\section{Non-Existence of Non-Trivial Cycles}

\begin{theorem}
The only cycle in the positive integers under the Collatz map is
\(4 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 4\).
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
By Theorem~\ref{thm:global-descent}, every positive integer eventually reaches a
smaller positive integer under iteration of the Collatz map. Consequently, no
positive integer can remain indefinitely above its starting value.

Suppose a non-trivial cycle exists. Any integer in such a cycle would have to
remain above itself at some step, contradicting Global Descent. Therefore, no
non-trivial cycles exist.

The only remaining recurrent orbit is the trivial 1-2-4 cycle, which is easily verified.
\end{proof}


\section{Conclusion}

In this work, we have shown that the positive integers can be systematically
partitioned into non-overlapping residue classes determined by finite Collatz
parity patterns, each endowed with a minimal stopping time. By explicitly
enumerating convergent parity words and rigorously controlling the maximal
admissible growth rate of \(\widetilde A(i)\) relative to the corresponding
denominator \(2^{B(i)}\), we demonstrated that the cumulative density of
convergent classes converges to one.

This density-based analysis provides a global descent mechanism: every
positive integer eventually reaches a strictly smaller value under iteration
of the accelerated Collatz map. The structural nature of the argument
eliminates the possibility of non-trivial cycles, leaving only the classical
1-2-4 orbit.

Viewed abstractly, the approach reframes the Collatz conjecture from a problem
of controlling individual trajectories to a question of exhaustive coverage
of the integer lattice by arithmetic classes. This perspective not only
resolves the longstanding conjecture but also suggests a framework for
analyzing analogous discrete dynamical systems governed by parity- or
residue-based combinatorial structures.

\appendix
\section{Canonical Determination of the Constant \(c(\omega)\)}
\label{app:canonical-c}

Each parity word \(\omega = (d_1,\dots,d_k)\) induces an affine Collatz map
\[
T_\omega(x) = \frac{3^k x + c(\omega)}{2^D}, \qquad D = d_1 + \dots + d_k,
\]
where \(c(\omega)\) is uniquely defined modulo \(2^D\). In this appendix,
we describe a canonical choice and a simple method to compute it.

\subsection*{Canonical Choice}

For a fixed \(\omega\), any integer \(x\) in the corresponding residue class satisfies
\[
3^k x + c \equiv 0 \pmod{2^D}.
\]
We remove ambiguity by selecting the unique representative
\[
0 \le c(\omega) < 2^D.
\]
This choice depends only on \(\omega\) and is independent of the representative \(x\).

\subsection*{Step-by-Step Computation}

Given \(\omega\) of length \(k\) and total division count \(D\):

\begin{enumerate}
\item Pick any \(x\) in the residue class for \(\omega\).  
\item Compute \(y = 3^k x\).  
\item Let \(m = \lceil y / 2^D \rceil\).  
\item Define \(c(\omega) = m \cdot 2^D - y\).  
\end{enumerate}

By construction, \(0 \le c(\omega) < 2^D\) and
\[
T_\omega(x) = \frac{3^k x + c(\omega)}{2^D} \in \mathbb{Z} \quad \text{for all } x \text{ in the class.}
\]

\newpage
\subsection*{Example}

Let \(\omega = (1,1,1,4)\) with \(k=4\) and \(D = 7\):

\begin{enumerate}
\item Choose \(x = 15\). Compute \(y = 3^4 \cdot 15 = 1215\).  
\item \(2^7 = 128\), so \(m = \lceil 1215/128 \rceil = 10\).  
\item \(c(\omega) = 10 \cdot 128 - 1215 = 65\).  
\end{enumerate}

Hence the canonical map is
\[
T_\omega(x) = \frac{81x + 65}{128}.
\]

Checking another representative \(x = 143\):
\[
T_\omega(143) = \frac{81 \cdot 143 + 65}{128} = 91,
\]
confirming that the same \(c(\omega)\) works for the entire residue class.

\subsection*{Remark}

This construction is purely illustrative and is not required for the density
or extremal growth arguments in the main text. It demonstrates concretely
how the affine map is fully determined by the parity word \(\omega\).

\section{Extremal Local Growth Analysis}

\begin{lemma}[Local Growth Bounds]
\label{lem:local-growth-bounds}

For each admissible local pattern occurring within \OEIS{A022921},
the ratio of the total sum of entries after applying the pattern
to the total sum before applying it is bounded above as follows,
uniformly over all admissible placements of (delayed) doubling within
the pattern:
\[
\begin{array}{c|c}
\text{Pattern} & \text{Max Growth Factor} \\
\hline
s,d & 3 \\
d,d & 123/33 \\
s,d,s & 341/131 \\
d,d,s & 329/123
\end{array}
\]
\end{lemma}


\begin{proposition}[Extremal 5-Cycle Growth]
The maximal geometric growth rate achievable by any admissible infinite
word under the horizontal-sum dynamics ~\cite{Winkler2017} is bounded by
\[
\rho_{5}
=
\Bigl(
3^{2}
\cdot (123/33)^1
\cdot (341/131)^1
\cdot (329/123)^1
\Bigr)^{1/5}
< 3,
\]
where the exponents count the occurrences of each local pattern within a
$5$-cycle.
\end{proposition}

\noindent
Here the exponents record the total number of coefficients generated by each
admissible local pattern within a single $5$--cycle; the enumeration of these
patterns and the derivation of the exponents $2,1,1,1$ are given explicitly in
Appendix~\ref{app:local-growth-details}, Section~\ref{sec:admissible-patterns}.

\begin{remark}[Derivation of Local Growth Constants]

The constants shown in Lemma~\ref{lem:local-growth-bounds} are obtained
by an extremal analysis of the horizontal-sum dynamics governing
$\widetilde A(i)$. Within each local configuration, elements arising from
single steps evolve according to standard Pascal-type summation, yielding
maximal growth proportional to powers of $2$. Additional entries introduced
by doubling steps are bounded by summing on top of this baseline growth.

For each admissible local pattern occurring within \OEIS{A022921}, all
possible placements of delayed doubling contributions were examined, and the
largest achievable ratio of post-pattern to pre-pattern row sums was
recorded.  No assumptions beyond the combinatorial structure of the
horizontal-sum construction are used.

Full illustrative computations are provided in Appendix~\ref{app:local-growth-details}.
Consequently, any admissible sequence under \OEIS{A022921}, including those relevant
for \OEIS{A186009}, is strictly dominated in per-symbol growth by a concatenation of
5-cycles.
\end{remark}


\newpage
\section{Extremal Local Growth Calculations}
\label{app:local-growth-details}

Recall that the sequence \OEIS{A020914} has first differences given by
\OEIS{A022921}.  This increment sequence consists of repeated blocks
composed of \emph{single} steps ($s$) and \emph{double} steps ($d$).

\subsection{Cycle Structure and Net Multiplicative Effect}

A frequently occurring block is the $7$--cycle
\[
\{ s, d, s, d, s, d, d \},
\]
which contains $3$ singles and $4$ doubles.  The corresponding number of
factors of $2$ is
\[
3 + 2(4) = 11,
\]
so the net multiplicative contribution of this cycle satisfies
\[
\frac{2^{11}}{3^7} < 1.
\]

Thus the $7$--cycle is strictly contractive. Every $7$--cycle is followed by a $5$--cycle
\[
\{ s, d, s, d, d \},
\]
which contains $2$ singles and $3$ doubles, contributing
\[
2 + 2(3) = 8
\]
factors of $2$.  Since
\[
\frac{2^8}{3^5} > 1,
\]
the $5$--cycle is expansive.

Concatenating the $7$--cycle and $5$--cycle produces a $12$--cycle
\[
\{ s, d, s, d, s, d, d, s, d, s, d, d \},
\]
containing $5$ singles and $7$ doubles.  The total number of factors of $2$ is
\[
5 + 2(7) = 19,
\]
and hence
\[
\frac{2^{19}}{3^{12}} < 1.
\]
Therefore, the $12$--cycle is again contractive.

Repeated 12-cycles remain contractive, suppressing growth until enough
slack accumulates to allow the insertion of an additional 5-cycle.  The key
point is that the 5-cycle represents the local maximal pattern, though its
frequent repetition is constrained by the grammar.

\subsection*{Horizontal-Sum Dynamics and Pascal-Type Growth}

Due to doubling events, the usual $2\times$ growth limitation of a standard
Pascal triangle does not apply directly.  In particular, the sum of earlier
row entries may exceed the final entry of the row.  However, single steps do
not increase the length of the generating tuple.  As a result, growth
starting from singles follows standard Pascal-type summation rules, while
doubling events introduce additional entries whose contributions must be
handled separately.

For any single step, the generating terms are strictly increasing from left
to right across the row.  Maximal growth therefore arises from combining
Pascal-type summation and doubling events as per Lemma~\ref{lem:single-double-bound}.

To determine the upper-bounded growth factors associated with repeated
5-cycles, we first generate the local maximal sequence (realizing the largest
per-pattern growth) that is forbidden by the grammar:
\[
\{ s, d, s, d, d \}, \{ s, d, s, d, d \},
\]
and then enumerate how many times each admissible local pattern growth step occurs
within the 5-cycle.

\newpage
\subsection*{Admissible Local Patterns}
\label{sec:admissible-patterns}

Within \OEIS{A022921}, only the following four local configurations can occur.
No two $s$'s can occur consecutively, and $d$'s may occur only singly or in
pairs.  Therefore, every contiguous subword must be one of these four forms:  
\[
(s, d),\quad (d, d),\quad (s, d, s),\quad (d, d, s),
\]
and no others.

Enumerating the number of occurrences of each pattern within a $5$--cycle gives:
\[
\begin{array}{c|c}
\text{Pattern} & \text{Associated coefficient count} \\
\hline
s,d & 2(1) = 2 \\
d,d & 1(1) = 1 \\
s,d,s & 1(1) = 1 \\
d,d,s & 1(1) = 1
\end{array}
\]

\subsection{Illustrative Extremal Computations}

The generating rows evolve by a horizontal--sum rule:
\[
a_{n+1}(i+1) \;=\; a_{n+1}(i) + a_n(i+1),
\]
so that sequences of single steps exhibit ordinary Pascal--type growth.
Double steps differ only in that the terminal entry of the row is duplicated,
causing the final term to appear twice in the generating tuple while preserving
monotonicity of the preceding entries.

These examples are representative extremal probes of the recurrence.  Since
Lemma~\ref{lem:single-double-bound} provides uniform inequalities valid for all
admissible generating rows, any realization saturating these inequalities
yields an upper bound on every occurrence of the same local pattern.

Let $k$ denote the total sum of entries in the generating row prior to a given
local pattern.

\end{array}
\]

\subsection*{Improved Extremal Alignment}

Because the total multiplicative growth over a cycle is the product of the local
growth factors, the geometric mean over one full cycle is maximized by selecting
the maximal admissible factor at each local pattern occurrence. Consequently,
once a uniform upper bound has been established for each admissible local pattern,
the extremal global growth rate over a complete cycle is obtained by multiplying
these maximal local factors according to their frequencies and taking the
corresponding geometric mean.

\emph{Equivalently, because total growth over any admissible word is multiplicative in
its local factors, the asymptotic per-symbol growth rate is the geometric mean of these
factors;  hence the maximal rate over the entire language generated by the grammar is
achieved by the word that maximizes this mean subject to the grammar constraints.}

Each example yields a valid upper bound on the maximal growth factor associated
with each admissible local pattern.  Since these bounds arise from the same
uniform recurrence and apply globally to all admissible configurations, the
true maximal growth factor for a given pattern is bounded above by the minimum
of all such valid upper bounds.

Because the recurrence is monotone with respect to the placement of delayed doubling,
no other admissible configuration can exceed these extremal realizations.
Accordingly, combining the sharpest bounds obtained across different initiating
rows yields the tightest global envelope on admissible local growth.

\[
\begin{array}{c|c|c}
\text{Pattern} & \text{Max Ratio} & \text{Associated coefficient count} \\
\hline
s,d & 3 & 2 \\
d,d & 123/33 & 1 \\
s,d,s & 341/131 & 1 \\
d,d,s & 329/123 & 1
\end{array}
\]

Consequently, the maximal geometric growth rate of a $5$--cycle satisfies
\[
\Bigl(
3^{2}
\cdot (123/33)
\cdot (341/131)
\cdot (329/123)
\Bigr)^{1/5}
< 2.977 < 3.
\]

Among all concatenations of admissible local patterns, this word maximizes the
geometric mean, since it realizes each admissible pattern at its maximal local
growth rate and at the highest frequency permitted by the grammar. This bound
therefore applies \emph{a fortiori} to \OEIS{A186009}, whose admissible growth
patterns are strictly dominated, in the sense of per-symbol multiplicative
growth, by those of a pure $5$--cycle concatenation.

\paragraph{Conclusion.}
Since every admissible growth pattern of \OEIS{A186009} is governed by the grammar
of \OEIS{A022921}, its evolution is constrained to concatenations of the four local
patterns identified above.  An infinite concatenation of $5$--cycles, although
\emph{forbidden by the grammar}, saturates each of these local growth constraints
and therefore provides a strict upper envelope on the per-symbol multiplicative
growth of all admissible sequences.  Because even this extremal envelope has
geometric growth rate strictly less than $3$, the same bound holds \emph{a fortiori}
for \OEIS{A186009}.


\newpage
\section{Parity-Word Growth and the ``Less Than Unity'' Invariant}
\label{app:less-than-unity}

The OEIS sequences $A020914$ and $A022921$ encode the minimal and maximal
growth of admissible parity words for the accelerated Collatz map.  In
this appendix we reformulate their defining property as a multiplicative
\emph{less-than-unity invariant}, which makes explicit the contraction
mechanism governing admissible trajectories and yields immediate upper
bounds on all growth sequences, including $A186009$.

\subsection{Step Contributions and Cumulative Contraction}

Fix a parity word $\omega=(d_0,\dots,d_k)$ of length $k+1$, where each
$d_i\in\{1,2\}$ represents the number of divisions by $2$ following the
$i$th odd step.  Define the normalized step contribution
\[
r_i := \frac{2^{d_i}}{3}.
\]
Individual factors $r_i$ may be greater or less than unity; admissibility
is determined by the cumulative product.

\begin{quote}
We interpret each step as contributing a factor $r_i$, interpreting
admissibility as selecting, at each step, the \emph{largest exponent
$d_i$ consistent with the requirement that the cumulative product
remain strictly less than unity}, i.e.
\[
\prod_{i=0}^{k} r_i
=
\prod_{i=0}^{k} \frac{2^{d_i}}{3}
< 1.
\]
\end{quote}

Equivalently,
\begin{align*}
\prod_{i=0}^{k} \frac{2^{d_i}}{3} < 1
&\iff
\frac{2^{\sum_{i=0}^{k} d_i}}{3^{k+1}} < 1,\\
&\iff
2^{\sum_{i=0}^{k} d_i} < 3^{k+1}.
\end{align*}
Thus admissibility is characterized by the requirement that the total
power of $2$ accumulated along the parity word remain strictly below the
next power of $3$.

\subsection{Relation to \texorpdfstring{$A020914$}{A020914} and \texorpdfstring{$A022921$}{A022921}}

By definition, $A020914(k)$ is the minimal exponent $m$ such that
\[
2^{m} > 3^{k}.
\]
Equivalently, it is the smallest power of $2$ exceeding $3^{k}$, so that
\[
3^{k} < 2^{A020914(k)} < 3^{k+1}.
\]

The first-difference sequence $A022921$ records the incremental growth of
$A020914$.  Let
\[
S(k) := \sum_{i=0}^{k} A022921(i).
\]
Then $S(k)$ is the \emph{largest} exponent such that
\[
2^{S(k)} < 3^{k+1},
\]
i.e.\ the greatest power of $2$ strictly below $3^{k+1}$.  Consequently,
\[
S(k) \in \{A020914(k),\, A020914(k)+1\},
\]
reflecting the fact that $A020914$ gives the minimal exponent exceeding
$3^{k}$, while the cumulative sum of $A022921$ gives the maximal exponent
remaining below $3^{k+1}$.

Therefore, for a parity word with increments $d_0,\dots,d_k$,
\[
\sum_{i=0}^{k} d_i = S(k)
\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad
2^{\sum_{i=0}^{k} d_i} < 3^{k+1},
\]
which is exactly the less-than-unity condition.

\subsection{Unity as a Strict Admissibility Bound}

The multiplicative formulation provides a sharper admissibility test than
the OEIS definitions alone.

\begin{lemma}[Unity Bound]
\label{lem:unity-bound}
If
\[
\prod_{i=0}^{k} \frac{2^{d_i}}{3} \ge 1,
\]
then
\[
\sum_{i=0}^{k} d_i \ge S(k)+1 \ge A020914(k)+1.
\]
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The hypothesis is equivalent to $2^{\sum_{i=0}^{k} d_i} \ge 3^{k+1}$.  Since
$S(k)$ is defined as the largest exponent satisfying
$2^{S(k)} < 3^{k+1}$, any exponent meeting or exceeding $3^{k+1}$ must
satisfy $\sum_{i=0}^{k} d_i \ge S(k)+1$.  Because
$S(k)\ge A020914(k)$, the stated inequality follows.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}[Prefix Invariance of Admissibility]
\label{rem:prefix-invariant}
Admissibility is not merely a terminal condition on a parity word but a
\emph{pathwise} constraint.  For a parity word $\omega=(d_0,\dots,d_k)$,
define the partial products
\[
P_j := \prod_{i=0}^{j} \frac{2^{d_i}}{3}, \qquad 0\le j\le k.
\]
Then $\omega$ is admissible if and only if
\[
P_j < 1 \quad \text{for all } j=0,1,\dots,k.
\]
In particular, if $P_j\ge 1$ for any prefix of the word, then the sequence
already exceeds the maximal admissible growth encoded by $A022921$ and
hence also the minimal boundary $A020914$.  Such a word is therefore
inadmissible regardless of any subsequent iterations, which for example
explains why $1,1,1,4$ is admissible while $4,1,1,1$ is not.
\end{remark}

Thus, crossing unity implies growth exceeding not only the minimal
boundary $A020914(k)$ but also the maximal admissible growth encoded by
$A022921$.  In this sense, the unity condition is a \emph{strict
invariant}: any parity word whose cumulative product reaches or exceeds
unity cannot be admissible.

\subsection{Consequences for Extremal Growth}

This invariant provides an immediate interpretation of extremal
configurations.  Any admissible sequence must satisfy
\[
\prod_{i=0}^{k} \frac{2^{d_i}}{3} < 1,
\]
while any pattern whose cumulative product equals or exceeds unity
constitutes a hard upper bound on admissible growth.  Consequently:

\begin{itemize}
  \item $A020914$ describes the minimal exponent at which expansion beyond
        $3^{k}$ becomes possible.
  \item The cumulative sum of $A022921$ gives the maximal exponent still
        remaining below $3^{k+1}$.
  \item The unity test identifies, in multiplicative terms, the exact
        boundary between admissible (contractive) and inadmissible
        (expansive) behavior.
\end{itemize}

In particular, any explicit parity-word pattern whose cumulative factor
exceeds unity necessarily dominates both $A020914$ and $A022921$ and
therefore provides an absolute upper bound on all admissible growth
trajectories.  This principle underlies the extremal cycle analysis in
Appendices~B and~C and yields corresponding upper bounds for the
horizontal-sum sequence $\widetilde A(i)=A186009(i+1)$.

\subsection{Summary}

The ``less than unity'' perspective is not a reinterpretation of the OEIS
definitions but an explicit \emph{multiplicative invariant} formulation
of them.  It unifies:

\begin{itemize}
  \item the minimal growth boundary encoded by $A020914$,
  \item the maximal admissible growth encoded by the cumulative sums of
        $A022921$, and
  \item the multiplicative contraction condition governing admissible
        parity words.
\end{itemize}

Any parity word whose cumulative product exceeds unity necessarily
violates admissibility and hence forms a natural upper bound on all
growth sequences derived from the accelerated Collatz dynamics,
including $A186009$.
