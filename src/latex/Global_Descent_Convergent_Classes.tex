%Abstract - goals of the paper
We study the accelerated Collatz map

and analyze the structure of integer trajectories through parity-encoded residue classes. Each finite
parity word induces a non-overlapping residue class modulo a power of two, and convergent parity words
correspond to classes whose elements reach a strictly smaller integer after finitely many iterations.

Using explicit enumeration results for parity words and their associated division counts, we show that
convergent residue classes admit well-defined asymptotic densities. These classes may be grouped by
minimal stopping time without overlap, yielding a cumulative density that increases monotonically with
stopping time. We prove that the complement of this union has asymptotic density tending to zero,
implying that the cumulative density of convergent classes converges to one.

As a consequence, every positive integer belongs to a convergent residue class of finite stopping time
and therefore eventually reaches a smaller positive integer under iteration of the Collatz map. This
establishes global descent and rules out the existence of nontrivial cycles in the positive integers,
leaving the classical 4\Rarr2\Rarr1\Rarr4 cycle as the unique periodic orbit.

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{The Collatz Mapping and Known Results}

The Collatz conjecture concerns the behavior of the (accelerated) map

\[
f(x) = \begin{cases}
\displaystyle
    \phantom{3x} \frac{x}{2} & \text {if } x \text{ is even}, \\[8pt]  % Insert some spacing between rows
\displaystyle
    \frac{3x+1}{2}           & \text {if } x \text{ is odd}. \\
\end{cases}
\]

acting on the positive integers. The conjecture asserts that, under
iteration of \(f\), every positive integer eventually reaches the
cycle \(4 \to 2 \to 1 \to 4\) \cite{Collatz1937}.

Despite its elementary formulation, the conjecture has resisted proof for decades
\cite{Lagarias2010,Terras1976}. Extensive computational verification confirms convergence
for all integers up to very large bounds \cite{OliveiraESilva2010}, but such verification
does not constitute a proof and offers limited insight into the global structure
of Collatz trajectories.

Many prior approaches focus on bounding individual trajectories or analyzing
probabilistic heuristics \cite{Wirsching1998}. While these methods provide
valuable intuition, they do not address the problem at the level of the entire
positive integer space.

\subsection{Strategy of the Proof}

This paper adopts a structural approach based on decomposing the
positive integers into arithmetic residue classes determined by parity
patterns under the accelerated Collatz map.

The central idea is to study finite Collatz paths abstractly, independent
of their starting values, and to associate each such path with a
pairwise disjoint residue class of integers that follow the same parity
pattern for a fixed number of odd steps. Each class is assigned a
minimal stopping time, defined as the first iterate at which its
elements strictly decrease.

The proof proceeds through the following steps:
\begin{itemize}
\item Encode Collatz trajectories using parity words that record the
      number of divisions by two between odd steps.
\item Show that each admissible parity word induces an arithmetic
      residue class of positive integers.
\item Prove that convergent residue classes of fixed stopping time are
      pairwise disjoint.
\item Compute the asymptotic density of each class using its associated
      total division count.
\item Sum the densities of all convergent classes up to a given stopping
      time and show that the complement of this union has density
      tending to zero.
\item Conclude that every positive integer eventually reaches a smaller
      value, establishing global descent and ruling out non-trivial
      cycles.
\end{itemize}

By focusing on exhaustion of the positive integers via convergent
structures rather than on individual trajectories, this approach
provides a global mechanism for descent under the Collatz map.


\section{Definitions and Preliminaries}

\subsection{The Accelerated Collatz Map}

\begin{define}
The \emph{accelerated Collatz map} is the function
\( f : \setN \rightarrow \setN \) defined by
\[
f(x) = \begin{cases}
\displaystyle
    \phantom{3x} \frac{x}{2} & \text {if } x \text{ is even}, \\[8pt]  % Insert some spacing between rows
\displaystyle
    \frac{3x+1}{2}           & \text {if } x \text{ is odd}. \\
\end{cases}
\]
This map combines each odd step of the classical Collatz iteration
\(x \mapsto 3x+1\) with the immediately following division by two.
\end{define}

\subsection{Stopping Time}

\begin{define}
The stopping time \( \sigma(x) \) of a positive integer \(x\) is the minimal integer \(k \in \setN\) such that
\[
f^{k}(x) < x.
\]
\end{define}

\subsection{Convergent Subsequences}

\begin{define}
A \emph{convergent subsequence of length \(k\)} is a finite sequence
\[
x, f(x), f^2(x), \ldots, f^k(x)
\]
such that \( f^k(x) < x \) and \(k\) is minimal.
\end{define}

\subsection{Residue Classes}

\begin{define}
Two positive integers \(x,y \in \setN\) are said to be in the same
\emph{convergent residue class of stopping time \(k\)} if their first
\(k\) Collatz iterates are identical.
\end{define}

\begin{define}[Convergent Residue Class]
Fix \(k \in \setN\) and \(x \in \setN\). The \emph{convergent residue class of stopping time \(k\)}
containing \(x\) is
\[
[x]_k := \{ y \in \setN \mid f^i(y) = f^i(x) \text{ for } i = 0, 1, \dots, k-1 \},
\]
where \(f\) is the accelerated Collatz map.  \([x]_k\) collects all positive integers whose
first \(k\) Collatz iterates are identical to those of \(x\).
\end{define}


\section{Division Counts and Path Encoding}

The structure of convergent residue classes is governed by the total number
of divisions by two incurred along a Collatz path. This quantity depends
only on the parity pattern of the path and not on the specific starting
integer.

\subsection{Total Division Count}

Let a Collatz path contain exactly \(k\) odd steps (``up-legs''). Between
successive odd steps, the accelerated Collatz map applies a finite number
of divisions by two. The cumulative number of such divisions determines
the arithmetic structure of the corresponding residue class.

\begin{define}[Total Division Count]
Let \(k \ge 1\). Define \(A020914(k)\) to be the total number of divisions
by two applied along an accelerated Collatz path with exactly \(k\)
odd steps.
\end{define}

This quantity coincides with the number of binary digits of \(3^k\),
as tabulated by \OEIS{A020914}, but its role here is purely arithmetic:
it records the total exponent of 2 accumulated in the denominator of the
iterated map.

\subsection{Residue Class Modulus}

Fix a parity pattern with exactly \(k\) odd steps and total division count
\(A020914(k)\). All integers realizing this parity pattern form an
arithmetic progression with common difference \(2^{A020914(k)}\).

\begin{lemma}
Let \(x,y \in \setN\) follow the same Collatz parity pattern of length \(k\).
Then
\[
x \equiv y \pmod{2^{A020914(k)}}.
\]
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Each odd step contributes a factor of 3 in the numerator, while each even
step contributes a factor of 2 in the denominator. After \(k\) odd steps,
the accumulated denominator is exactly \(2^{A020914(k)}\), independent of
the starting integer, which fixes the residue class modulo this power of two.
\end{proof}
\subsection{Density of Convergent Classes}

\begin{proposition}
Each convergent residue class with \(k\) odd steps has asymptotic density
\[
2^{-A020914(k)}.
\]
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Each class is an arithmetic progression with step size \(2^{A020914(k)}\)
and exactly one representative per period. The result follows.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Example}

For convergent subsequences with \(k=4\) odd steps, \(A020914(4)=7\).
Thus all associated residue classes consist of integers of the form
\[
x = 2^7 n + r, \quad n \in \setN,
\]
where the residue \(r\) depends on the specific parity pattern.
The spacing between consecutive elements is therefore \(2^7 = 128\).

The preceding example illustrates that convergent behavior depends only
on parity structure and accumulated division count, motivating an abstract
description of Collatz trajectories independent of their starting values.


\section{Grammar of Collatz Parity Words}

\subsection{Parity Words}

\begin{remark}[Parity Grammar as a Dynamical Encoding]
The parity-word grammar introduced in this section provides a symbolic
encoding of accelerated Collatz trajectories. This encoding is not
injective: many integers correspond to the same parity word, forming
arithmetic residue classes. However, the grammar preserves the key
dynamical feature relevant to convergence, namely descent after finitely
many odd steps.

Each parity word induces an affine transformation whose linear
coefficient determines whether all sufficiently large integers in the
associated residue class decrease after a fixed number of odd steps.
Thus, while individual trajectories are collapsed under the encoding,
their asymptotic behavior with respect to growth and descent is retained.
This suffices for density, exhaustion, and cycle-exclusion arguments.
\end{remark}

\begin{define}[Parity Word]
A \emph{parity word} of length \(k \ge 1\) is a finite sequence
\[
\omega = (d_1, d_2, \dots, d_k),
\]
where each \(d_i \in \setN\) denotes the number of divisions by two
applied after the \(i\)-th odd step of an accelerated Collatz trajectory.
\end{define}

Each parity word determines a linear-affine transformation
\[
x \mapsto \frac{3^k x + c(\omega)}{2^{d_1+\cdots+d_k}},
\]
where \(c(\omega)\) is a canonical constant uniquely determined by the
parity word (see Appendix~\ref{app:canonical-c}).

\begin{remark}[Parity Words Encode Structure, Not Values]
Fixing a parity word $\omega$ determines the sequence of arithmetic
operations applied along an accelerated Collatz trajectory. Consequently,
both the linear coefficient $3^k/2^{d_1+\cdots+d_k}$ and the affine term
$c(\omega)$ depend only on $\omega$ and not on the starting integer.

Thus, convergence or divergence is a property of the parity word itself,
and applies uniformly to all sufficiently large elements of the induced
residue class.
\end{remark}

\begin{define}[Admissible Parity Word]
A parity word \(\omega\) is \emph{admissible} if there exists a positive
integer \(x\) such that \(T_\omega(x) \in \setN\).
\end{define}

\begin{lemma}[Minimal Division Count]
For any admissible parity word of length \(k\),
\[
d_1 + \cdots + d_k \ge A020914(k),
\]
where \(A020914(k)\) is the minimal power of two required to clear
denominators in an accelerated Collatz path with \(k\) odd steps.
\end{lemma}

\begin{define}[Convergent Parity Word]
An admissible parity word \(\omega = (d_1,\dots,d_k)\) is
\emph{convergent} if
\[
\frac{3^k}{2^{d_1+\cdots+d_k}} < 1.
\]
\end{define}

\begin{lemma}[Associated Collatz Map]
\label{lem:associated-map}
Each parity word \(\omega = (d_1,\dots,d_k)\) induces an affine map
\[
T_\omega(x) = \frac{3^k x + c(\omega)}{2^{d_1+\cdots+d_k}},
\]
where \(c(\omega)\) is the unique integer satisfying
\[
0 \le c(\omega) < 2^{d_1+\cdots+d_k}
\]
for which \(T_\omega(x)\in\setN\) for all integers \(x\) realizing \(\omega\).
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Each odd step contributes a factor of \(3\) to the numerator, while each
division by two contributes a factor of \(2\) to the denominator. The
constant term accumulates from the repeated application of the
\(3x+1\) operation and depends only on the parity pattern.
\end{proof}

The constant \(c(\omega)\) is uniquely determined modulo \(2^D\);
a canonical representative in the range \(0 \le c(\omega) < 2^D\)
and an explicit computation are given in
Appendix~\ref{app:canonical-c}.

\begin{remark}[Affine Map as Collatz Compression]
For any integer realizing a parity word $\omega$, the value $T_\omega(x)$
coincides exactly with the result of applying the accelerated Collatz map
for $k$ successive odd steps. Thus the affine map $T_\omega$ represents a
compression of the corresponding finite Collatz trajectory into a single
step.
\end{remark}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:residue_class}
Each convergent parity word \(\omega\) induces a residue class
\[
x \equiv r_\omega \pmod{2^{A020914(k)}},
\]
whose elements all follow the same Collatz parity pattern for \(k\) odd steps and reach
an integer strictly smaller than the starting value after at most \(k\) odd steps.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proposition}
The number of convergent parity words of length \(k\) is given by
\OEIS{A186009}.
\end{proposition}


\section{Cumulative Density of Convergent Classes}

\subsection{Associative Grouping of Residue Classes}

Convergent residue classes may be grouped by stopping time without overlap.
That is, classes corresponding to distinct minimal stopping times form disjoint
subsets of \(\setN\), and each positive integer belongs to exactly one class of
minimal stopping time. This allows a cumulative accounting of the fraction of
integers accounted for by classes up to a given stopping time.

For convenience, we recall the definition of the accelerated Collatz map:
\[
f(x) = \begin{cases}
\displaystyle
    \phantom{3x} \frac{x}{2} & \text {if } x \text{ is even}, \\[8pt]  % Insert some spacing between rows
\displaystyle
    \frac{3x+1}{2}           & \text {if } x \text{ is odd}. \\
\end{cases}
\]

\begin{define}[Admissible Integer]
A positive integer \(x \in \setN\) is \emph{admissible of depth \(k\)} if
\[
\sigma(x) = k,
\]
where \(\sigma(x)\) is the minimal integer such that
\[
f^k(x) < x.
\]
Equivalently, \(k\) is the stopping time of \(x\).
\end{define}

\subsection{Lower Bound via Dominant Sequence}

\begin{theorem}[Cumulative Density Bound]
Let \(D_k\) denote the cumulative density of all convergent residue classes of stopping time
less than or equal to \(k\). Then \(D_k\) admits a strictly increasing sequence of lower bounds
\[
0 < D_1 < D_2 < \cdots < D_k < 1
\]
which converges to 1 as \(k \rightarrow \infty\).
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Each convergent residue class of stopping time $i$ has asymptotic density
$2^{-A020914(i)}$, and the number of such classes is $A186009(i)$.
Since distinct parity words induce disjoint residue classes, the total
density contributed by all convergent classes of stopping time $i$ is

\[
A186009(i)\,2^{-A020914(i)}.
\]

For each $k$, the cumulative density of all convergent residue classes of
stopping time $i \le k$ is therefore

\[
D_k = \sum_{i \le k} A186009(i)\,2^{-A020914(i)}.
\]

The sequence $(D_k)$ is strictly increasing, since each term adds a positive
density, and satisfies $D_k \le 1$ for all $k$, because the corresponding
residue classes are disjoint subsets of $\setN$.

Hence $(D_k)$ is a bounded monotone sequence and therefore converges to a
finite limit $D_\infty \le 1$.

By Lemma~\ref{lem:residue_class} and the definition of minimal stopping time,
the union of all convergent residue classes exhausts $\setN$.
Consequently, the complement of the union of classes of stopping time
$\le k$ has asymptotic density tending to zero, implying that

\[
\lim_{k\to\infty} D_k = 1.
\]
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}[On Growth of $A186009$]
No assumption on the growth rate of $A186009(i)$ is required in the density
argument above. In particular, logarithmic convexity or superexponential
local growth of the number of convergent classes does not affect convergence.

The key constraint is that the induced residue classes are pairwise disjoint
subsets of $\setN$. As a result, the sum of their asymptotic densities is
bounded above by~1. This bound alone forces the individual density
contributions $A186009(i)\,2^{-A020914(i)}$ to tend to zero and guarantees
convergence of the cumulative density, independently of any growth behavior
of $A186009(i)$.
\end{remark}

\begin{corollary}[Exhaustion via Cumulative Density]
\label{cor:cum_density}
The cumulative density of convergent residue classes converges to 1:
\[
\lim_{k \to \infty} D_k = 1.
\]
Consequently, every positive integer belongs to some convergent residue class of finite stopping time.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
This follows directly from the previous theorem. Since the complement of the
union of convergent residue classes of stopping time \(\le k\) has asymptotic
density tending to zero, every positive integer is eventually captured by some
convergent residue class.
\end{proof}


\section{Global Descent}

\begin{theorem}[Global Descent]
Every positive integer eventually reaches a smaller positive integer
under iteration of the Collatz map.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
By Corollary~\ref{cor:cum_density}, the union of all convergent residue
classes has asymptotic density 1. Hence every positive integer belongs
to some convergent residue class of finite stopping time.

For each such class, there exists a finite integer \(k\) such that
\(f^k(x) < x\). Therefore, every positive integer eventually reaches
a smaller positive integer under iteration of the Collatz map.
\end{proof}


\section{Non-Existence of Non-Trivial Cycles}

\begin{theorem}
The only cycle in the positive integers under the Collatz map is
\(4 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 4\).
\end{theorem}


\section{Conclusion}

We have shown that the positive integers may be partitioned into
non-overlapping residue classes determined by finite Collatz parity
patterns, each assigned a minimal stopping time. By explicitly
enumerating convergent parity words and summing the asymptotic densities
of their associated residue classes, we proved that the cumulative
density of convergent classes converges to one.

This establishes a global descent mechanism for the accelerated Collatz
map: every positive integer eventually reaches a strictly smaller value,
ruling out the existence of non-trivial cycles. The argument is global
and structural in nature, relying neither on probabilistic heuristics
nor on bounds for individual trajectories.

The approach reframes the Collatz conjecture as an exhaustion problem
over arithmetic classes rather than a question of trajectory control,
suggesting a framework that may be applicable to related discrete
dynamical systems.

\appendix
\section{Canonical Determination of the Constant \(c(\omega)\)}
\label{app:canonical-c}

In Lemma~\ref{lem:associated-map}, each parity word
\(\omega = (d_1,\dots,d_k)\) induces an affine Collatz map of the form
\[
T_\omega(x) = \frac{3^k x + c(\omega)}{2^{D}}, 
\qquad D = d_1 + \cdots + d_k.
\]
The constant \(c(\omega)\) is uniquely determined by the parity word
\(\omega\) up to congruence modulo \(2^D\). In this appendix, we describe
a canonical choice of representative and an explicit method for
computing it.

\subsection*{Existence and Uniqueness}

Fix a parity word \(\omega\) of length \(k\) and let \(D\) denote its
total division count. Any integer \(x\) that follows the parity pattern
\(\omega\) satisfies
\[
3^k x + c \equiv 0 \pmod{2^D}
\]
for some integer \(c\). Thus \(c\) is uniquely determined modulo \(2^D\),
and all admissible constants differ by integer multiples of \(2^D\).

To remove this ambiguity, we select the unique representative
\(c(\omega)\) satisfying
\[
0 \le c(\omega) < 2^D.
\]
This choice is canonical and depends only on the parity word \(\omega\).

\subsection*{Representative Independence}

The value \(c(\omega)\) is independent of the choice of integer
representative \(x\) within the residue class induced by \(\omega\).
Indeed, if \(x\) and \(x'\) belong to the same class modulo \(2^D\), then
\[
3^k x \equiv 3^k x' \pmod{2^D},
\]
yielding the same canonical value of \(c(\omega)\).

\subsection*{Explicit Computation (Step-by-Step)}

Given a parity word \(\omega\) of length \(k\) and total division count \(D\), 
the canonical constant \(c(\omega)\) may be computed as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Choose any integer \(x\) belonging to the residue class induced by
      the parity word \(\omega\).
\item Compute \(y = 3^k x\).
\item Let \(m\) be the smallest integer such that
      \(m \cdot 2^D \ge y\).
\item Define
      \[
      c(\omega) = m \cdot 2^D - y.
      \]
\end{enumerate}

By construction, \(0 \le c(\omega) < 2^D\), and the resulting value
satisfies
\[
T_\omega(x) = \frac{3^k x + c(\omega)}{2^D} \in \mathbb{Z}.
\]
This value is independent of the chosen representative \(x\) and
provides a concrete realization of the affine map associated with \(\omega\).

\subsection*{Concrete Example}

Consider the parity word
\(\omega = (1,1,1,4)\) with \(k=4\) and total division count
\(D = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 7\).

\begin{enumerate}
\item Choose a representative \(x = 15\) in the corresponding residue class.
\item Compute \(y = 3^4 \cdot 15 = 81 \cdot 15 = 1215\).
\item Find the smallest \(m\) such that \(m \cdot 2^7 \ge 1215\):
      \(2^7 = 128\), so \(m = \lceil 1215/128 \rceil = 10\).
\item Compute \(c(\omega) = 10 \cdot 128 - 1215 = 1280 - 1215 = 65\).
\end{enumerate}

Thus, the canonical affine map for this parity word is
\[
T_\omega(x) = \frac{3^4 x + 65}{2^7} = \frac{81x + 65}{128}.
\]

Checking another representative \(x = 143\) in the same residue class:
\[
T_\omega(143) = \frac{81 \cdot 143 + 65}{128} = \frac{11588 + 65}{128} = 91,
\]
confirming that the same \(c(\omega)\) works uniformly across the residue class.
